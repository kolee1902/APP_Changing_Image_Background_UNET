# Background Changing with U-Net

## 📌 Introduction

This project applies a **U-Net model** for background segmentation and replacement. By training the U-Net architecture on image data, the model can accurately distinguish foreground objects from the background, allowing us to replace or modify the background in images.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the power of deep learning in **image segmentation** and **computer vision** applications, with a focus on practical background changing.

## ⚙️ Installation & Requirements

To run the notebook, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib opencv-python
```

You can also open the notebook in **Google Colab** for easier GPU support.

---

## 🚀 Usage

1. Open the provided Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`).
2. Prepare your dataset (images for training/testing).
3. Run the notebook cells step by step to:

   * Preprocess the images.
   * Train the U-Net model.
   * Test background removal and replacement.
4. Replace the background with any custom image of your choice.

## 📊 Results

The model is capable of detecting foreground objects and replacing the background.
(👉 You can add some example images here later to demonstrate before/after results.)
